Spring features
1)working with POJO - Plain old java object
2)Dependency Injection
3)MVC
4)REST
5)Security
6)Batch
7)Data
8)AOP
Spring framework helps us build enterprise java applications and spring boot helps us bootstrap the process of creating spring application.
Spring boot gives us a production ready application
when you want to deploy spring project without springboot, you have to have a server

    Dependency Injection
- What is dependency injection?
We generally create and work with objects and these objects, work with/ depends on other objects
so we need external services that will help us inject this required objects to where we need them
when we add @Component to a class, we automatically make it dependent, it can be accessed by another class
@Autowired : This is used to connect a class with another class
This entire concept is dependency injection.
Making your application loosely coupled
Dependency injection: This helps the developer focus on the logic and when he requires an object, it will make it available.
Bean: A bean is simply an object that Spring creates and manages for you and it is usually inside a spring container.
when you annotate a class with @Component,
spring automatically creates a single object of that class. and makes it available in the spring container
By default spring framework us a design pattern called "singleton"
In singleton, you get only one instance of the object.
To change from single,
You will use an annotation called @Scope and chose the value you want .
when you use @Autowired,
spring will search for that particular class and connect with the class you want to use it in.
it default search is by type.
@Qualifier: This searches by name when using @Autowired
The default name of a class is small letter of the class name, and you can change the default name in the @Component annotation.

    Spring boot JDBC
JDBC means Java Database Connectivity.
JDBC is a Java technology that allows Java programs to talk to a database.
It is like a bridge between your Java code and your database.
Data source: gives your application connections to the database, has configurations and it helps us with something called connection pull.
JDBC Template
This helps with data source and helps write code in efficient way
How to use Spring boot jdbc
In your dependencies,
add jdbc api and a database(postgres or mySql)
then click generate and unzip
if you use a database,
we will configure th following in the application.properties
-spring.datasource.url
-spring.datasource.name
-spring.datasource.username
-spring.datasource.password
Repository: The Repository is responsible for connecting to the database.
We use @Repository annotation for repository class
we use jdbcTemplate in the repository
