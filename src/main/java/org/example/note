    Dependency Injection
- What is dependency injection?
We generally create and work with objects and these objects, work with/ depends on other objects
so we need external services that will help us inject this required objects to where we need them
when we add @Component to a class, we automatically make it dependent, it can be accessed by another class
@Autowired : This is used to connect a class with another class
This entire concept is dependency injection.
